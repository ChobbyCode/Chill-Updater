     * === Notes ===
     * 
     * - Do not put random ass variables in this file as it will become hard to manage and become extremely hard to maintain,
     *   ONLY use this for variables if almost everything will use it, otherwise store the strings in files and have copy if newer set to true.
     * 
     * - If you do not follow those notes, I hope that when you make a stack overflow post it gets 1000 down votes :) Happy Travels!
